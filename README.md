## Amazon Vine Analysis
   I have a question for you.  What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word “Amazon”.  Most likely Prime, shipping or maybe even Apple Fire stick.  The name is no longer associated with just one product, but everyone knows the company.  The company has changed over the years, they have started shipping more products, expanded into countries outside of the U.S. and even started producing their own moves and television shows.  One of their most recent programs is the Amazon Vine Program.
   The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers to receive a list of the reviews that Amazon sells for them. A company pays a fee to Amazon and then provides products to the Amazon Vine members who then publish a review.  The main purpose of our analysis it to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.  The product that we chose to provide analysis on was the video games.  This dataset has the potential to provide a plethora of information, but we chose to narrow it down to the following.
* Vine Member (Y or N)
* Purchased the Product (Y or N)
* Feedback
* Feedback Date
* Rating (1 – 5)

From our analysis we were able to determine that we had 90 vine members provide a review on this particular product.  44 members rated the product 5 stars, which means that 48% of the reviews were 5 stars.  Further analysis revealed that 24 reviews were rated at 4 stars, which shows that 75% of reviews were 4 or 5 stars.  This is an very positive response to the product.  We will continue to analyze the feedback and product titles to determine if there are specific games that are rated lower than others or perhaps if there is a common issue amongst responders that causes them to rate a particular game lower than others.
